> GluonTS Deep Learning in R. 


## GluonTS Deep Learning in R

Modeltime GluonTS integrates the __Python GluonTS Deep Learning Library__, making it easy to develop forecasts using Deep Learning for those that are comfortable with the [Modeltime Forecasting Workflow](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/). 

```{r, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/m4_hourly_forecast.jpg")
```


## Installation Requirements

__Important: This package is being maintained on GitHub (not CRAN). Please install the GitHub version, which is updated with the latest features:__

```
# Install GitHub Version 
remotes::install_github("business-science/modeltime.gluonts")

# Install Python Dependencies
modeltime.gluonts::install_gluonts()
```

For more detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting guidance, visit our [Installation Guide](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime.gluonts/articles/managing-envs.html). 

## Make Your First DeepAR Model

Make your first `deep_ar()` model, which connects to the GluonTS `DeepAREstimator()`. For a more detailed walkthough, visit our [Getting Started Guide](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime.gluonts/articles/getting-started.html).

```{r example, eval = F}
library(modeltime.gluonts)
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)

# Fit a GluonTS DeepAR Model
model_fit_deepar <- deep_ar(
    id                    = "id",
    freq                  = "M",
    prediction_length     = 24,
    lookback_length       = 48,
    epochs                = 5
) %>%
    set_engine("gluonts_deepar") %>%
    fit(value ~ ., training(m750_splits))

# Forecast with 95% Confidence Interval
modeltime_table(
    model_fit_deepar
) %>%
    modeltime_calibrate(new_data = testing(m750_splits)) %>%
    modeltime_forecast(
        new_data      = testing(m750_splits),
        actual_data   = m750,
        conf_interval = 0.95
    ) %>%
    plot_modeltime_forecast(.interactive = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/deepar_example_1.png")
```






## Meet the modeltime ecosystem 

> Learn a growing ecosystem of forecasting packages

```{r, echo=F, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="The modeltime ecosystem is growing"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/modeltime_ecosystem.jpg")
```

Modeltime is part of a __growing ecosystem__ of Modeltime forecasting packages.

[_High-Performance Time Series Course_](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting/)

### Time Series is Changing

Time series is changing. __Businesses now need 10,000+ time series forecasts every day.__ This is what I call a _High-Performance Time Series Forecasting System (HPTSF)_ - Accurate, Robust, and Scalable Forecasting. 

 __High-Performance Forecasting Systems will save companies by improving accuracy and scalability.__ Imagine what will happen to your career if you can provide your organization a "High-Performance Time Series Forecasting System" (HPTSF System).

### How to Learn High-Performance Time Series Forecasting

I teach how to build a HPTFS System in my [__High-Performance Time Series Forecasting Course__](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting). You will learn:

- __Time Series Machine Learning__ (cutting-edge) with `Modeltime` - 30+ Models (Prophet, ARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest, & many more)
- __Deep Learning__ with `GluonTS` (Competition Winners)
- __Time Series Preprocessing__, Noise Reduction, & Anomaly Detection
- __Feature engineering__ using lagged variables & external regressors
- __Hyperparameter Tuning__
- __Time series cross-validation__
- __Ensembling__ Multiple Machine Learning & Univariate Modeling Techniques (Competition Winner)
- __Scalable Forecasting__ - Forecast 1000+ time series in parallel
- and more.
