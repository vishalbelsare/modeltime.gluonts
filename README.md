> GluonTS Deep Learning in R.

## GluonTS Deep Learning in R

Modeltime GluonTS integrates the **Python GluonTS Deep Learning
Library**, making it easy to develop forecasts using Deep Learning for
those that are comfortable with the [Modeltime Forecasting
Workflow](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/).

## Installation Requirements

**Important: This package is being maintained on GitHub (not CRAN).
Please install the GitHub version, which is updated with the latest
features:**

    # Install GitHub Version 
    remotes::install_github("business-science/modeltime.gluonts")

    # Install Python Dependencies
    modeltime.gluonts::install_gluonts()

For more detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting
guidance, visit our [Installation
Guide](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime.gluonts/articles/managing-envs.html).

## Make Your First DeepAR Model

Make your first `deep_ar()` model, which connects to the GluonTS
`DeepAREstimator()`. For a more detailed walkthough, visit our [Getting
Started
Guide](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime.gluonts/articles/getting-started.html).

``` r
library(modeltime.gluonts)
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)

# Fit a GluonTS DeepAR Model
model_fit_deepar <- deep_ar(
    id                    = "id",
    freq                  = "M",
    prediction_length     = 24,
    lookback_length       = 48,
    epochs                = 5
) %>%
    set_engine("gluonts_deepar") %>%
    fit(value ~ ., training(m750_splits))

# Forecast with 95% Confidence Interval
modeltime_table(
    model_fit_deepar
) %>%
    modeltime_calibrate(new_data = testing(m750_splits)) %>%
    modeltime_forecast(
        new_data      = testing(m750_splits),
        actual_data   = m750,
        conf_interval = 0.95
    ) %>%
    plot_modeltime_forecast(.interactive = FALSE)
```

[*High-Performance Time Series
Course*](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting/)

### Time Series is Changing

Time series is changing. **Businesses now need 10,000+ time series
forecasts every day.** This is what I call a *High-Performance Time
Series Forecasting System (HPTSF)* - Accurate, Robust, and Scalable
Forecasting.

**High-Performance Forecasting Systems will save companies by improving
accuracy and scalability.** Imagine what will happen to your career if
you can provide your organization a “High-Performance Time Series
Forecasting System” (HPTSF System).

### How to Learn High-Performance Time Series Forecasting

I teach how to build a HPTFS System in my [**High-Performance Time
Series Forecasting
Course**](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting).
You will learn:

- **Time Series Machine Learning** (cutting-edge) with `Modeltime` - 30+
  Models (Prophet, ARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest, & many more)
- **Deep Learning** with `GluonTS` (Competition Winners)
- **Time Series Preprocessing**, Noise Reduction, & Anomaly Detection
- **Feature engineering** using lagged variables & external regressors
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **Time series cross-validation**
- **Ensembling** Multiple Machine Learning & Univariate Modeling
  Techniques (Competition Winner)
- **Scalable Forecasting** - Forecast 1000+ time series in parallel
- and more.
